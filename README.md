# TorahBot
This is a telegram chat bot for getting audio files of new lectures from [YUTorah](https://yutorah.org)

### Why Flask?
This app is deployed to [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine) which is designed to be a webserver host. Flask is used as a workaround and GAE allows for the bot to run indefinitely

*note: when starting up the bot go to the GAE URL to trigger the bot startup script*
